This ToDo List app was created and designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You can add things to your ToDo list. 
You can cross them out by clicking on a specific Todo List item.
You can also delete an item by clicking on the trash can that appears to the left when you hoover over the specific thing on your ToDo List.
